Local environment basic setup instructions:

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into cloned repo on local
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run android`

My knowledge ends from here, if you run into problems unfortunately you are on your own. You might get a message saying that there isn't a simulated device detected, you will have to figure out how to launch one so that Expo can connect to it
